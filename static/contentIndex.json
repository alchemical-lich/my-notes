The Temple served as the central governance institution for the region and the town of Demestos developed around it.\nThe Temple itself served as home to the priesthood of Demeter, gathering place for religious feasts, and storage and processing facility for grain, dairy products, and livestock. The Temple safeguarded food production for the whole region and offered blessings for the surrounding farmlands by distributing water from the Fountain of Demeter.\nAn internal conflict within the priesthood over leadership between the Archon Kleistos and Serene Exculpator Adrianna led to the demise of the temple and cursed the town and surrounding region.

Archon Kleistos. powerless to stop her, sacrificed himself to seal the demon and Adrianna in the Inner Sanctum.\nWith the Fountain of Demeter spoiled by the demon’s presence, the Temple supply of holy water turned corrupted and spoiled the surrounding lands. An outbreak of disease and repeated crop failures led to the demise of the town.\nNow, the ruins of Demestos and the abandoned Temple of Demeter stand alone and are merely remembered for their prior importance.\nThree weeks ago, Margos of the Maw established residence in the ground level ruins of the Temple.
