<p>ADD TIMETABLE FOR CHRISTMAN?</p>
<p>This is Christman’s secret lair in the Frassberg region. He has lived here for decades and made the cave system his home. There are three “factions” active in the dungeon:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Christman Grippertenius</strong>. Spends most of his days drinking himself into a stupor. Will either kill or capture any intruders. Prisoners will be tortured and eventually killed. He treats Lise Mueller as a scullery maid and otherwise ignores her. He is afraid of the ghost of Getrude Kaasman. If he thinks a part of the cave system is currently being haunted by the ghost, he will move as far away as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lise (Lischen) Mueller</strong>. A satanic witch. She let herself be captured by Christman and is his current “wife”. Christman is known for haven taken many “wives” (i.e., abducted women and kept them in his dungeon against their will) over the years. In his old age, he has done so less frequently and mostly does it out of habit and for having someone around to help him clean. Lise is a cunning witch that has out herself into Christman’s hands in order to conceive a child with him. Because Christman has no interest in her (or anyone for that matter) and is mostly drunk, she is scheming to spoil is alcohol supply, cut off future deliveries, and otherwise get him to pay attention to her. She is not beyond considering murdering Christman to get what she needs from his corpse. She has cast Charm on Christman, but his black soul has weakened the effects of the spell. Deep down, Christman fears Lise and tries to find excuses to be away from her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ghost of <strong>Gertrude Kaasmann</strong>. One of Christman’s prior “wives”. He murdered her and her child 23 years ago. She is a mere echo of a mother’s grief and a general menace to any living creature. If she can be made to remember what happened to her, she can become an, albeit temporary, ally against Christman.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are otherwise few creatures about in the dungeon. Christman’s lair is a murderhole which he stalks like a predator.  Try to play up the atmosphere of discovering serial killer’s home (e.g., think Jame Gumb’s basement in the movie Silence of the Lambs).</p>
<p>Christman has accumulated a huge amount of treasure over the years. Anyone brave enough to enter the caves and survive, might lay claim to unimaginable riches.</p>
<p>Due to Christman’s familiarity with the dungeon, the base chance of Surprise increases from 2-6 to 4-6 for PCs. If Christman retreats from a fight, he has a 2-6 chance of simply vanishing when he runs into another room and PCs lose line of sight. This is not a supernatural ability and if PCs have extraordinary means of keeping track of Christman, this ability is countered.</p>

<p><strong>L1</strong>: Main entrance to the cave. Smells of acrid smoke. Graffiti on the wall at the entrance: “Cristman’s Castle”. 6ft further down the tunnel, PCs can see more markings on the wall. The markings are pure gibberish, trying to invoke a foreign alphabet. Christman built a spiked pit trap (8ft deep) filled with lye right next to the markings. Save vs breath (DCC: Reflex save DC 10) or take 1d6 damage from the spikes and 1 point of caustic burn damage for every round in the pit. If the PC took 4 or more points of damage from the spike, they injured one of their extremities and it is more difficult to climb out of the pit.</p>
<p><strong>L2</strong>: Secret entrance on ground level, completely covered by poison ivy. Touching the ivy Save vs Poison (DCC: Fort save DC 11) or develop a serious rash that lingers for 1d4 days. Cannot wear armor while afflicted by the rash. Cure Disease (DCC: Lay on Hands for 2 HD) removes.</p>
<p><strong>L3</strong>: Secret entrance. On a ledge 20ft up from the ground and hard to see. At the cave entrance, a thin tripwire is connected to a bell to the alarm bells in L4. When bells are rung, 1D6+3 of Christman’s dogs appear within 1 turn.</p>
<p><strong>L4</strong>: Central intersection. Tripwires with alarm bells. Bells attract 1D6+3 of Christman’s dogs appear within 1 turn.</p>
<p><strong>L5</strong>: Room with a barricade that faces and blocks access to L4. An additiona piece of barricade can be moved quickly to block the northern exit. Two loaded crossbows lean against the wall. They have poisoned arrow tips. If hurt, save vs Poison (DCC: Fort save DC 12) or spend 1d3 rounds wretching and unable to act.</p>
<p><strong>L6</strong>: Kennel room. Smells like dog feces and urine. Barks can be heard when approaching. 6 dog kennels total, only one is closed. Inside, one injured but aggressive dog (sprained leg). One large kennel is up on the elevated rock ledge. Old carpets and furs on the ground. They cover a hidden pressure plate. If someone steps on it, spring-loaded wooden barriers block the two exits and the door to the kennel on the elevated rock ledge opens.Inside this cage is a hungry <strong>Bear</strong>, trained by Christman to prefer human flesh.</p>
<p><strong>L7</strong>: The smell of dog urine and feces. The room is filled with additional dog kennels. Barrels full of dog food. There are at least 1d6+2 dogs resting in this room.</p>
<p><strong>L8</strong>: Storage room. Filled with sacks of flour, barrels of fish, cheeses, smoked meats. Cage with iron bars and a heavy lock (DCC Pick locks DC 7). Inside are racks of wine (60 bottles of wine, each worth 20 sp). At the Northwestern side of the room, a wall carpet hides a secret vertical, winding tunnel with a rope that leads to Level 2 (<strong>L24</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>L9</strong>: Fletchery. Chaotic workshop, tools strewn about, pieces of wood, piles of feathers. Whoever is working here has high skill, but is extremely untidy and disorganized. A total of 37 arrows can be recovered from this room. Northern side has a tunnel exit that leads to Level 2 (<strong>L14</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>L10</strong>: From the ceiling hang long wires with thin glass bulbs attached. The lenght of the wires varies from 1 ft off the floor to 5ft off the floor. The bulbs do not touch each other and there is at most 1 ft room between two bulbs. There are burns marks all over the floor and walls. The glass bulbs are filled with a highly-reactive alchemical substance that is activated when moved about too much. If someone carelessly walks through the room and a bulb starts swinging, it triggers a reaction and the bulb explodes in a fiery explosion, sending glass shards everywhere. This triggers all other bulbs to explode. Carefully traversing the room requires a Save vs. Breath (DCC Reflex save DC 12) (or some other approach). Failure triggers the trap and causes 6d6 explosion damage to anyone in the room and 2d4 continued alchemical burn damage for 1d4+2 rounds (the goey substance does not come off easily).</p>
<p><strong>L11</strong>: A terrible smell of decay, feces, and urine. A room used for skinning and tanning room. Several skinned animal carcasses hang from the ceiling (some have human bite marks). One skinned human carcass among the animals. A trough for tanning.</p>
<p>Hanging like wind chimes from the ceiling, dried, stretched out and flayed baby corpses.</p>
<p>“Tanzt liebe Kindlein tanzt, Gnipperteinga euer Vater macht euch den Tanz”</p>
<p><strong>L12</strong>: A storage room. Nine large wooden and closed barrels. Barrels contain human bodies in a brine solution.</p>
<p><strong>L13</strong>: Storage for discarded clothes, arms, armor from killed enemies (3 sets of leather armor, 1 set of chain mail, 3 spears, 2 bows, 1 long sword, 2 short swords). Three cave wasp nest on the ceiling, one more nest build into a set of magical +1 plate armor. Wasps will react to any disturbance in the room.</p>

<p><strong>L14</strong>: Stone platform. South: Stairs descending from Level 1 <strong>L9</strong>. Northeast: Winding, roughly-hewn stone steps that lead down to <strong>L15</strong>.
